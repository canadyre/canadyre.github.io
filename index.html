    <section id="about">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> Passionate scientist, teacher, and engineer with 6+ years of research and teaching 
            experience who would like to use expertise in ML, adversarial ML, and deploying AI/ML 
            at the Edge to tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems. Strives to make 
            novel and impactful contributions in this area that could positively impact many people. 
            Very receptive to feedback, new information, different views, or even project direction 
            changes.
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy cooking, throwing darts, tennis, golf, skiing, and  watching films, 
            particularly horror. I also enjoy the fermentation of vegetables and drinks. I am very 
            passionate about food, equality, and the environment,  so I regularly volunteer at 
            a local non-profit farm-to-kitchen organization that is diverting food waste into 
            nutritious meals for the food insecure. I did this by helping to prepare meals for 
            a small industrial kitchen as well as helping out at a community/production garden 
            where some of the produce was donated back to the kitchen.</p>
